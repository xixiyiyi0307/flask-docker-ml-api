Question1:
a)
Code in app.py.
b)
The estimated Average Treatment Effect (τ̂) is -9.1057, with a p-value=0.000 < 0.001, indicating strong statistical significance. 
This suggests that participation in the carbon offset program is associated with a 9.1057-point decrease in engagement score, controlling for sustainability spending.
c)
The estimate τ̂ can be interpreted causally under the following assumptions:
Ignorability — All confounding variables that influence both treatment assignment (Wi) and the outcome (Yi) are controlled for by Xi.
Correct model specification — The linear regression model correctly captures the relationship between variables, with no omitted variable bias.
Independent and identically distributed observations — The error term εi is uncorrelated with the predictors and has a mean of zero.

Question 2:
a)、b)、c)
Code in app.py.

Explanations:
app.py defines a Flask API that loads and uses a trained linear regression model to provide predictions based on input parameters w and x.
The Dockerfile sets up a consistent environment with all necessary dependencies, ensuring the app can run anywhere without local setup issues.
Containerization with Docker improves reproducibility and simplifies deployment by isolating the application from host system differences.
